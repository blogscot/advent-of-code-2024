This year I'm going to try the [Advent of Code challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2024) using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with some help from [Codeium AI](https://codeium.com/). In previous years I've used [Clojure](https://github.com/blogscot/advent-of-code-2021) and [Common Lisp](https://github.com/blogscot/advent-of-code-2022).
